        I used to hate programming because it felt complicated and overwhelming, with endless errors that made
         me want to quit. 
        But as I kept trying, writing small pieces of code that actually worked felt incredibly rewarding. 
        Slowly, I began to understand logic, patterns, and how to break big problems into simple steps. 
        That feeling of creating something from scratch—something that works—became addictive. 
        Now, the same challenges that once frustrated me are what excite me the most, 
        and programming has turned from my least favorite subject into something I genuinely enjoy learning 
        every day.
